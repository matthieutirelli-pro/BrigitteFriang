We can talk with Alphonse Bertillon that sends us a logfile "access.log"
He's searching for the IP address of a member of Evil Gouv 

We find the line : 
179.97.58.61 - - [Nov 05 2020 16:22:20] "POST /login HTTP/1.1" 200 476 "-" "Evil Browser"

If we send that IP to Alphonse Bertillon we end up with an API call to : 
https://challengecybersec.fr/chat/check-proof?contact=5&proof=179.97.58.61

That's give us an image "evil_country_landscape.jpg"
